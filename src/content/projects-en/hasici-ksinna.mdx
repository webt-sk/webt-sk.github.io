### Description of the project

As part of the one-day event "Firefighters' Day Kšinná" organized by the volunteer fire brigade in the village of Kšinná, we developed a presentation website.

The goal of this website was to provide information about the event, its program, and participants. The page includes details about the start and end times of the event, various competitions, demonstrations of firefighting equipment, and other attractions. The presentation aims to capture the atmosphere and important moments that will occur during the event.

The objective was to create a simple and clear website that would inform visitors about the key aspects of the event and encourage their participation in this significant local event organized by the fire brigade in the village of Kšinná.
