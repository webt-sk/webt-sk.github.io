### Description of the project

The goal of the project was to create a website for the newly established beer bar in Zemianská Olča.

The website serves exclusively as a presentation of the company and allows visitors to obtain information about
the food and drink menu. One of the main features of the site is the display of the daily menu, which is updated every day.
Visitors can browse the permanent offer of the food and drink menu, which lists the various foods and drinks available in the Radegastovna.
The website was designed with an attractive design, clarity, and easy navigation for users in mind.

The overall result is a presentation of the Radagastovna through a website that effectively communicates the offer
of food and drinks and will attract visitors to visit this new gastronomic establishment.
