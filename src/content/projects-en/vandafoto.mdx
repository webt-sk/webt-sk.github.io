# VandaFoto

## Portfolio website for wedding and family photographer 

### Client

Vanda Karailieva

### The project was worked on by

Gabriel & Marcel

### Link to the project

[vandafoto.sk](https://vandafoto.sk)

### Description of the project

We created a website as a portfolio for a female photographer who can add her photos.

The goal of the project was to create a presentation of photographic works with an emphasis on simplicity and clarity.
The website allows the photographer to log into her account and upload her photos to a portfolio.
The system for uploading photos has been implemented so that adding and organizing images is simple and intuitive for the photographer.

The overall result is a professional website that effectively presents the photographer's portfolio and allows for easy editing
and updating the content by adding new photos.
