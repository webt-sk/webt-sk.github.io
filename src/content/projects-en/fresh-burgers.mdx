### Description of the project

The project involved renovating the website for a restaurant in Dubnica nad Váhom, focusing on providing online ordering services.

The website is designed to showcase the meals and beverages offered by the restaurant and allows visitors to conveniently and quickly place orders online. Users have the option to browse the menu, choose from various categories of dishes, and add them to their cart. The website also provides information about opening hours, contact details, and any current promotions or special offers by the restaurant.

The goal of the project was to create a clear, modern, and intuitive website that would facilitate customers in ordering meals and enhance communication between the restaurant and its clients.
