## Frontend for an agency selling tickets for various events

### Client

### Description of the project

The project was to create a complete frontend of a website called tixresell.com, which deals with ticket reselling for various events.

Our task was to design and implement all the necessary functionalities,
including login, registration, client zone, and administration panel for editing individual actions on the website.
Users have the option to register, log into their account and browse available events.
In the client zone, they can purchase tickets and track their orders. The administration panel allows the web administrator to add,
edit and delete actions, manage user accounts, and monitor orders.
The project required the creation of an intuitive and clear user interface.

The overall result is a fully functional web-based system that makes buying and reselling tickets easy and convenient for tixresell.com users.
